    "In this homework, Jupyter Notebook is mainly used for visualizations and reporting the results. We will start implementing a vanilla DQN agent and continue with implementing a RAINBOW agent. In general, there are 3 scripts to run a training experiment with the DQN agent on an environment. First one is the model where we implement the policy and the loss function. Second one is the Trainer class, where all of the training and evaluation is handled. This class is responsible for parameter updates, running the environment, and keeping track of necessary statistics as well as saving the model (agent and optimizer). Lastly, the third script initiates the agent, trainer, environment, and starts the training with the given arguments.\n",
